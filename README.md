# Elephant Trivia

#How to Play:

Click on the elephant image to trigger the first question.  Questions will be displayed one by one.

After you select an answer, it will highlight green or red depending on whether or not it is correct (green is correct, red is wrong).  If you select a wrong answer, the correct answer will also show so that you'll know the info for cocktail parties!

The game will keep score for you and will also tell you how many questions you've answered.  Once you finish the game, you can restart the fun by clicking the elephant image again.
