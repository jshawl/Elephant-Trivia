<h1>Elephant Trivia

<div class="scoreCard"></div>
<div class="info">
  <p>This is a trivia game about elephants. You'll be presented with one question at a time, and will need to answer in order to move on to the next.
  <p id="important">When you're ready to get started, click the image of the elephant above!</p>
  <p>If these facts strike your fancy, I recommend checking out <a href="http://www.elephantnaturepark.org">Elephant Nature Park</a>.  Just north of Chiang Mai in Thailand, ENP is an santuary for elephants, founded by Lek Chailert, who rescues elephants in need and provides them a safe haven where they are able to live out their lives free of any work (including tourist rides) and abuse. ENP is also home to dogs, cats and water buffalo.
