<div class="info">
  <p>This is a trivia game about elephants. You'll be presented with one question at a time, and will need to answer in order to move on to the next.
  <p>When you chose an answer, it will turn green if it's the correct choice, or red if it's not the answer we were looking for.  In those cases, the correct choice will also show.</p>
  <p id="important">When you're ready to get started, click the image of the elephant above!</p>

<div class="enp">If these facts strike your fancy, I recommend checking out <a href="http://www.elephantnaturepark.org">Elephant Nature Park</a>.  Just north of Chiang Mai in Thailand, ENP is an santuary for elephants, founded by Lek Chailert, who made it her mission to advocate for elephants on their behalf, rescue the ones in need and provide them a safe haven where they are able to live out their lives free of any work (including tourist rides) and abuse. ENP is also home to dogs, cats and water buffalo.
